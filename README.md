- **Avg Duration (min)** - Average booking length

### Dimensions
- **Tenant Name** - Client/customer (multi-tenant filtering)
- **Site** - Building/location
- **Floor** - Level within site
- **Resource Type** - Desk, Room, Parking, Visitor
- **Department** - Organizational unit
- **Tenant Region** - Geographic area
- **Booking Source** - Origin of reservation
- **Date** - Booking date
- **Status** - Current state
- **Office Days Policy** - Hybrid work configuration

## Technology Stack

- **React 18.2** - Frontend framework
- **React Router 6.8** - Client-side routing
- **ThoughtSpot Visual Embed SDK 1.40** - Analytics embedding
- **Inter Font** - Typography
- **CSS3** - Styling with CSS variables

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- ThoughtSpot Cloud instance access

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Cloudbooking_analytics
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure ThoughtSpot connection in `src/config/thoughtspot.js`:
```javascript
export const THOUGHTSPOT_CONFIG = {
  thoughtSpotHost: 'https://your-instance.thoughtspot.cloud',
  username: 'your-username',
  password: 'your-password',
  liveboardId: 'your-liveboard-id',
  modelId: 'your-model-id'
};
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The app will run on `http://localhost:3006`

## Configuration

### ThoughtSpot Settings

Update `src/config/thoughtspot.js` with your ThoughtSpot environment details:

- **thoughtSpotHost** - Your ThoughtSpot Cloud URL
- **username** - Service account username
- **password** - Service account password
- **liveboardId** - GUID of the main analytics Liveboard
- **modelId** - GUID of the Workspace Bookings model

### Authentication

The application currently uses Basic authentication. For production, consider:

- **Trusted Authentication** - Token-based SSO for seamless integration
- **SAML/OAuth** - Enterprise single sign-on
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** - Tenant-level data isolation

## Production Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build/` directory.

### Environment Variables

For production deployments, use environment variables instead of hardcoded credentials:

```javascript
// .env.production
REACT_APP_TS_HOST=https://your-instance.thoughtspot.cloud
REACT_APP_TS_LIVEBOARD_ID=your-liveboard-id
REACT_APP_TS_MODEL_ID=your-model-id
```

Update `thoughtspot.js` to read from environment variables:
```javascript
export const THOUGHTSPOT_CONFIG = {
  thoughtSpotHost: process.env.REACT_APP_TS_HOST,
  liveboardId: process.env.REACT_APP_TS_LIVEBOARD_ID,
  modelId: process.env.REACT_APP_TS_MODEL_ID
};
```

### Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Never expose credentials in client-side code for production use.

For production deployments:
1. Implement server-side token generation
2. Use ThoughtSpot Trusted Authentication
3. Configure proper CORS settings
4. Enable row-level security for multi-tenant data isolation
5. Set up SSL/TLS encryption
6. Implement audit logging

### Hosting Options

- **Static Hosting** - AWS S3 + CloudFront, Azure Static Web Apps, Netlify, Vercel
- **Container Deployment** - Docker + Kubernetes
- **Traditional Hosting** - nginx, Apache
- **Embedded in Portal** - Integrate into existing Cloudbooking web application

## Usage

### For Enterprise Customers

1. **Login** - Access via SSO from Cloudbooking portal
2. **View Dashboard** - Review key metrics and visualizations on Liveboard page
3. **Explore Data** - Use filters to drill down by site, department, or time period
4. **Ask Questions** - Navigate to AI Analyst for natural language queries
5. **Export Insights** - Download reports for team meetings

### For Account Managers

1. **Pre-Renewal Review** - Check customer usage patterns and engagement
2. **Identify Opportunities** - Spot underutilized resources for optimization discussions
3. **Performance Tracking** - Monitor occupancy and utilization trends
4. **Custom Analysis** - Use AI Analyst for ad-hoc customer questions

### Example Use Cases

**Occupancy Analysis**
```
"What is our occupancy % by site for the last 30 days?"
```

**License Optimization**
```
"Show me sites with less than 50% utilization"
```

**No-Show Patterns**
```
"No show rate by tenant region"
```

**Resource Planning**
```
"Compare desk bookings vs meeting room bookings by month"
```

## Customization

### Styling

The application uses CSS variables for easy theme customization. Main variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
/* Cloudbooking Brand Colors */
--primary-color: #5BC5F0;
--primary-hover: #4db8e6;
--text-dark: #1e293b;
--text-light: #64748b;
--background: #f8fafc;
```

### ThoughtSpot Theme

ThoughtSpot components are customized via `customCSS` in the embed configuration. Key variables:

```javascript
'--ts-var-button--primary-background': '#66CCFF',
'--ts-var-root-background': '#ffffff',
'--ts-var-accent-primary': '#66CCFF',
```
